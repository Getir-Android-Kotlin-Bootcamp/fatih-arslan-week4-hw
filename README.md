# Network-Operations (fatih-arslan-week4-hw)

#### In this homework, I did network operations (POST - GET) without a third-party library like Retrofit2.

#### For network operations, I utilize `BufferedWriter` and `OutputStreamWriter` from `java.io` and `HttpURLConnection` and `URL` from `java.net`.

#### I also used `JSONObject` from `org.json` to represent DTOs. All operations are handled in the IO thread.

#### For app architecture, I utilize MVVM, and for better reasoning, I use unidirectional data flow.
